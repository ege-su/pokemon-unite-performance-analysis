# Pokemon Unite Performance Analysis
This is my term project for DSA210 - Intoduction to Data Science course in Fall 2024-25.

## Motivation

In this project, I am going to analyze my personal performance in my Pokemon Unite matches to work out the optimal gameplay strategy for myself. I am a solo player; I do not have a fixed group of friends with whom I regularly play Pokemon Unite as a team of five. So, the gameplay decisions I make during a match are all a result of *my* own understanding of the state of the game at a particular point in the match.

By analyzing my match history data I am going to obtain from Unite API, I want to find out whether my performance is related to the role of the Pokemon (character) I pick in a match, or to the specific Pokemon itself, or to another condition. I believe that finding out what kind of character I play best will give me a new insight into my playing style â€” and my personality.

## Data Source

I am going to scrape my personal match history data from the Unite API website.
